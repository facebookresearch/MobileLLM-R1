# MobileLLM-R1

MobileLLM-R1 is a new series of efficient reasoning models within the MobileLLM family. Alongside the models, we provide comprehensive training recipes and data sources to ensure reproducibility and facilitate further research.

This repository includes demonstration code to reproduce the pretraining, mid-training, and SFT stages of MobileLLM-R1, as well as the corresponding intermediate checkpoints and data mix weights.

## News
- Sept 12, 2025: ðŸš€ MobileLLM-R1 models are released on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/collections/facebook/mobilellm-r1-68c4597b104fac45f28f448e).
- Sept 29, 2025: ðŸŒŸ The technical report "[MobileLLM-R1: Exploring the Limits of Sub-Billion Language Model Reasoners with Open Training Recipes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24945)" is also available! Please check it out. 

## Highlights

Remarkably, the MobileLLM-R1 950M, pre-trained on only **~2T high-quality tokens** and with fewer than 5T total training tokens, achieves comparable or superior performance to Qwen3 0.6B, which was trained on 36T tokens, across MATH, GSM8K, MMLU, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks.

Compared to existing fully open-source models, MobileLLM-R1 950M model achieves **~5Ã— higher accuracy on MATH** compared to the Olmo 1.24B model and **~2Ã— higher accuracy** relative to the SmolLM2 1.7B model, despite being substantially smaller in parameter scale. In addition, MobileLLM-R1 950M outperforms both Olmo 1.24B and SmolLM2 1.7B **by a wide margin on coding benchmarks**, establishing a new state-of-the-art among fully open-source models.

### Training stages and hyperparameter details

In the pretraining phase, MobileLLM-R1 models are randomly initialized and optimized using the Adam optimizer with hyperparameters (Î²_1, Î²_2, Îµ) = (0.9, 0.95, 1e-8), coupled with a weight decay coefficient of 0.1. The learning rate follows a 2k-step warmup schedule and then decays linearly from its peak to 10\% of the maximum.

In the mid-training phase, we use Adam optimizer with learning rate linearly decays from its maximum value to zero. We employ knowledge distillation with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model as the teacher, where the student is trained via minimizing the KL divergence between its output logits and the teacher logits.

In the post-training phase, we use the Adam optimizer with zero weight decay. The learning rate warmup ratio is set to 0.03 for general-purpose SFT and 0.1 for reasoning-specific SFT, and it linearly decays from its maximum value to zero. Full training hyperparameters are provided in the table below.

| Stage | Phase | Tokens / Samples | BS | Sequence Length | Steps | LR | #GPUs | Training Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-training | Phase1 | 2T tokens | 16 | 2k | 500k | 4.00E-03 | 16 x 8 | 4-5 days |
|  | Phase2 | 2T tokens  | 16 | 2k | 500k | 4.00E-03 | 16 x 8 | 4-5 days |
| Mid-training | Phase1 | 100B tokens  | 4 | 4k | 50K | 3.60E-04 | 16 x 8 | 1-2 days |
|  | Phase2 | 100B tokens | 4 | 4k | 50K | 3.60E-04 | 16 x 8 | 1-2 days |
| Post-training | General SFT | 866K samples | 4 | 4k | 2 epochs | 5.00E-06 | 16 x 8 | ~2h |
|  | Reasoning SFT | 6.2M samples | 8 | 32k | 4 epochs | 8.00E-05 | 16 x 8 | ~2.5days |


## Quick Start

To load the pretrained model for further fine-tuning or evaluation:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/MobileLLM-R1-950M")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("facebook/MobileLLM-R1-950M")
```

## Pretraining

### Training code
The pretraining code that includes support for data mixing is available under [`./pretraining`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MobileLLM-R1/tree/main/pretrain). 
Example code:
```
cd ./pretraining
bash run_pretrain.sh
```

Note that our implementation does not include efficiency optimizations; for training speedups, you may refer to open-source efficiency implementations such as [torchtitan](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan) or [torchtune](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune).

# Inference

## Inference examples

Transformers

```py
from transformers import pipeline
import torch

model_id = "facebook/MobileLLM-R1-950M"

pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model_id,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
)

# Math problem / default scenario
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}."
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "Compute: $1-2+3-4+5- \\dots +99-100$."},
]

# C++ coding scenario
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": (
            "\nYou are a helpful and harmless assistant. You should think step-by-step before responding to the instruction below.\n\n"
            "Please use c++ programming language only.\n"
            "You must use ```cpp for just the final solution code block with the following format:\n"
            "```cpp\n# Your code here\n```\n"
        )
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a C++ program that prints 'Hello, World!'."},
]

# Python coding scenario
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": (
            "\nYou are a helpful and harmless assistant. You should think step-by-step before responding to the instruction below.\n\n"
            "Please use python programming language only.\n"
            "You must use ```python for just the final solution code block with the following format:\n"
            "```python\n# Your code here\n```\n"
        )
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a Python function that returns the square of a number."},
]

outputs = pipe(
    messages,
    max_new_tokens=8192,
)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1])
```

You can also run inference with vLLM. You only need to register the model architecture Llama4ForCausalLM with the vLLM ModelRegistry.
```bash
from vllm.model_executor.models.llama4 import Llama4ForCausalLM
from vllm.model_executor.models.registry import ModelRegistry
ModelRegistry.register_model("Llama4ForCausalLM", Llama4ForCausalLM)
```

Here, CommonSense Avg. denotes an average of 8 tasks in CommonSense Reasoning benchmarks including ARC-easy, ARC-challenge, BoolQ, PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, OBQA, and WinoGrand. Models with fewer than 150M parameters do not yield reliable MMLU scores and are therefore denoted as 'â€”'.

For AIME, we evaluate models across 64 runs and report the average accuracy. For LiveCodeBench, results are reported as the average accuracy across 16 runs. Models with fewer than 400M parameters do not produce reliable AIME scores and are therefore denoted as 'â€”'.
